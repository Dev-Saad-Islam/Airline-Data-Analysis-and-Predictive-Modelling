# Airline-Data-Analysis-and-Predictive-Modelling:

This project develops a model to predict airline customer satisfaction. Among various models tested, XGBoost emerged as the most effective, achieving a 94.13% accuracy rate.

To enhance its performance, we carefully selected 18 key variables. This balanced complexity and accuracy, meeting our marketing goals while reducing errors in identifying satisfied and dissatisfied customers.

The model's reliability was tested on new data, consistently predicting customer satisfaction with 94.13% accuracy. Demonstrating its potential for real-world deployment.
